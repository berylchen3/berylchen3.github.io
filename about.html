          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a junior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the
            University of Utah, with a minor in Mathematics. My primary
            interests are in reinforcement learning, robotic manipulation, and
            AI systems that can help people in the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I have been working on reinforcement learning for robotic
            manipulation in the LL4MA Lab and on a security and user-behavior analysis project in collaboration
            with the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC). I also enjoy
            teaching and have served as a teaching assistant for core CS
            courses.

          <h2>Research &amp; Selected Projects</h2>

          <h3>Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">LL4MA Lab, Kahlert School of Computing &mdash; Feb. 2025 – Present</p>
          <p>
            Designing and implementing custom Gymnasium environments for the
            Franka Panda robotic arm in PyBullet, focusing on pick-and-place
            manipulation. I train Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policies with dense
            reward shaping and domain randomization, and I am exploring
            hierarchical control by separating grasping and placement policies
            coordinated by a higher-level switching policy.
          </p>

          <h3>CHPC Security &amp; User Behavior Analysis</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">
            Center for High Performance Computing &mdash; May 2024 – Aug. 2024
          </p>
          <p>
            Assisted in a security study involving CHPC users by designing
            surveys, cleaning and analyzing user log data, and combining Python
            scripts with SQL-based aggregation. The goal was to better
            understand user behaviors and support the design of robust security
            measures.
          </p>

          <h3>Vector Golf &mdash; Educational App Development</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">
            Kahlert School of Computing &mdash; Aug. 2024 – Dec. 2024
          </p>
          <p>
            Implemented core gameplay logic in C++ and Qt for an educational
            physics game that teaches vector concepts. I worked on converting
            user input vectors into ball motion in a Box2D-based environment,
            designed interactions between the ball and the world, and added
            feedback effects such as flag animation and particle effects.

            Participated in the “Shanghai Digital Waterway Initiative” by
            developing backend services in Java (Spring Boot) for a
            cloud-based urban planning platform, designing RESTful APIs, and
            helping optimize multi-source data integration pipelines.

          <p>
            Supported large undergraduate classes in Data Structures &amp;
            Algorithms and Accelerated Object-Oriented Programming. I guided
            students through problem-solving sessions, helped prepare assignment
            and exam materials, and worked with instructors to address learning
            challenges.
